	This the one of the coolest feature i learned today 

	AUTO COMPLETION

	After we have an word typed in the vim file we can simple use the keys :

	ctrl + p	--> word with previous pattern 
	ctrl + n	--> word with next pattern 


	Vim will auto generate list of words  you have typed in the file 

	use arrow keys to navigate across the suggested words


	*** when using the complex variable name or methods names
